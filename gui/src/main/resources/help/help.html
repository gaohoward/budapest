<h3>
<li>Introduction</li>
<p>This tool is used to browse various data files of an Artemis broker
in order to find useful informations, as in debugging for example.</p>

<p>For information about Artemis please go to the <a href="https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/">

</a>.</p>
<p>This GUI tool can handle hugh dat files without consuming much of the memory.
It loads and displays log entries in page mode, each time only one page is loaded.
It groups data files into projects so it can be viewed, analyzed with a clear
structure.</p><br/>

<li>Getting Started</li>
<p>First you need to create a project: </p>

<p>Then open the project </p>

<li>Analyzing the data</li>
<p>On the right pane above the log entries there is a toolbar that provides tools
for analyzing the log.</p>

<p>The text field is for you to input some expressions that are used together with
the buttons to its right.</p><br/>

<li>The <b>&lt&ndash</b> and <b>-></b> buttons</li>

<p>They can locate a record entry based on what you input in the text field. When
you press either button, it searches each line and try to find if it contains
the string in the text field. Based on which button you pressed, it searches forward
("->") or backward ("&lt&ndash").</p><br/>

<li>The <b>"R"</b> button</li>

<p>The R button will created a filtered data file from the project based on the 
expression you input in the text field. The expression can be </p>

a simple word, for example <b>error</b>, or<br>
an 'and' expression, for example <b>error & warn</b>, or<br>
an 'or' expression, for example <b>error | warn</b>, or<br>
a 'not' expression, for example <b>!error</b>, or <br>
a combination of above, for example <b>error & warn & !jboss</b><br>

<p>spaces are ignored. The precedence of operators are <br>
! > & > | <br>
however you can use braces "()" to change it.</p>

<p>
By default all filtering are NOT case sensitive. If you need case-sensitive
matching, use <b>-m</b> switch, like<br>
<b>-m ERROR & warn | Exception<b><br>
</p>

<p>
To use special characters like & or | in expressions, you need to escape it
with backslash, example:
<b>Exception\&error<b><br>
it will match record lines who contain "Exception&error" (case insensitive).
</p>

<br/>
<li>The <b>"X"</b> buttons</li>

<p>The X button, when pressed, will filter the target records with
java regular expressions. Any value in the text field will be taken
and interpreted as Java Regular Expression. The filtered records
contains entries from the targe log that has a match to the regular expression.</p><br>

<br/>
<li>The <b>"&lt"</b> and <b>">"</b> buttons</li>
<p>The two buttons are used to turn pages.</p><br>

<li>The Goto button (<b>G</b>)</li>
<p>The last button is goto button. It allows you to go to a specific line
by its line number.</p>
<br/>
<b>note:</b> to go to the last line, input -1.<br/>
